CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION
  Continuous Integration is the practice of merging small code changes frequently.

CI 
  When we runa build, Travis CI clnes our Github REpository into a virtual environment and carries out a series of tasks to build and test our code.  If we pass all the tests Travis CI can deploy our code to heroku.

  there is a TravisCI .org for public repositories (free).  The .com is not free.

COMMON WORDS FOR TRAVIS CI IN DOCS
  JOB - an automated process that clones our repository and compiles code and runs tests  if it returns a 0 we pass if it returns anything but a 0 we failed.

  PHASE -- the steps of a job.  For example sinstall and script and then optional deploy

  BUILD- a group of jobs

  STAGE -- a group of jobs that run in parallel (Not important?)
